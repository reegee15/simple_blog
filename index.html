        <h1>Miami Heat take Game 1 in series against the New York Knicks</h1>
            <p>The Miami Heat continue their winning streak by beating the New York Knicks 108-101 making them the 
            first 8th seed in NBA history to win 5 of their first 6 playoff games. Led by <em>Jimmy Butler</em>, who had 25 points, the Miami Heat were able to take 
            a game where it seemed like they would lose.</p>
            <p>Throughout the first quarter it seemed that the Knicks were in control as Miami could not defend the duo of Jalen Brunson and RJ Barrett. The Knicks came into the game blazing
                hot, ending the first with an 11 point lead.
